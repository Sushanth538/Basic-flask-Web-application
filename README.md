Project Title: Basic Frontend Project Using Python Flask
Project Overview:
This project is a basic frontend web application built using Python’s Flask framework. The main objective was to improve web development skills, focusing on both the backend (using Flask) and frontend technologies. The project allowed for hands-on experience with handling web requests, rendering HTML templates, and connecting frontend elements with backend functionality, thus enhancing web development proficiency.

Technologies Used:
Python: The main programming language used for both backend and frontend tasks.
Flask: A micro web framework for Python that is used to build the web application's backend.
HTML/CSS: To create the structure and styling for the frontend of the application.
Jinja2: A templating engine for Python, which is used with Flask to render dynamic HTML pages.
